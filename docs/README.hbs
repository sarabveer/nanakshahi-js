## Notes

### Nanakshahi Calendar

This library is based on the Nanakshahi calendar passed by Sri Akal Takht Sahib in 2003 CE.

All Gurpurabs and historical dates are reckoned with their solar dates. An exception to this are the movable lunar dates which are to be reckoned using the Bikrami calendar until further Panthic consensus.

The Nanakshahi functions will only calculate dates after Nanakshahi adoption in 2003 CE. Any dates before March 14, 2003 CE (535 NS) will return with an `Out of Range` error.

### JavaScript `Date()` Object

In this library, the Date object has been given in the local time of the client. This ensures that the Gregorian date calculated by the functions is correct regardless of timezone.

## Acknowledgements

* Guru Sahib, who inspires us into Sikhi.

* Pal Singh Purewal, who explained various concepts in the Bikrami and Nanakshahi Calendars to me and answered my various technical and historical questions. Spent countless hours verifying the calculations done by me.

* E. M. Reingold and N. Dershowitz for their *Calendrical Calculations* book and their calendar functions, which serve as the base for the movable Gurpurab calculations done in this library.

* My father, Jasjit Singh, whose curiosity in the Nanakshahi and Bikrami calendar systems inspired me to find answers to his technical questions.

## Contributing

To get started, clone this repo and run `npm install` inside this directory.

This repository follows the **Airbnb's Javascript Style Guide**, with a few minor modifications. Notably, spaces should be included inside parentheses and brackets (weird, right!). An ESLint file is provided, and your code will automatically be checked on-commit for style. It is recommended to install an ESLint plugin for your editor (VS Code's `ESLint` plugin works out of the box), so you can receive linter suggestions as you type.

When writing commit messages, please follow the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)** specification.

Markdown and HTML JSDoc documentation is generated automatically, on commit, however, if you'd like to preview any changes to documentation, `npm run build-docs` will update `README.md`. `README.md` should *not* be edited, instead apply modifications to `README.hbs`.

The general workflow for contributing:

- Fork/create a new branch.
- Write or update existing tests with expected results
- Implement functions/changes
- Add JSDoc function documentation and examples
- Create a pull request with the changes
